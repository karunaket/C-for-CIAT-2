The user enters the size of the array and its elements in sorted order.

The user enters the key that needs to be searched in the array.

The binary search algorithm is applied to the array.

If the key is found in the array, the program prints its index.

If the key is not found in the array, the program prints a message saying so.


The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the array in half until the key is found or the search interval is empty. At each step, the middle element of the search interval is compared with the key. If the middle element is equal to the key, the search is successful and the index of the key is returned. If the middle element is greater than the key, the search continues in the left half of the search interval. If the middle element is less than the key, the search continues in the right half of the search interval.
