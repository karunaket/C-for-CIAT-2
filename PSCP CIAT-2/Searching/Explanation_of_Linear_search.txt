The user enters the size of the array and its elements.

The user enters the key that needs to be searched in the array.

The linear search algorithm is applied to the array.

If the key is found in the array, the program prints its index.

If the key is not found in the array, the program prints a message saying so.


The linear search algorithm works by comparing each element of the array with the key that needs to be searched. If a match is found, the index of that element is returned. If the entire array is searched and no match is found, the function returns -1 to indicate that the key was not found in the array.
