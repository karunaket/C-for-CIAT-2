The program prompts the user to enter the size of the array and its elements.

It reads the input from the user and stores it in an integer array called "arr".

The program applies the bubble sort algorithm to the array. This algorithm works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements of the array that are in the wrong order until the entire array is sorted.

The program uses two nested loops to perform the bubble sort. The outer loop runs from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of the array. This loop controls the number of passes needed to sort the array.

The inner loop runs from 0 to n-i-1, where i is the current pass number. This loop compares adjacent elements of the array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

After the bubble sort is complete, the program prints the sorted array to the screen.

The program ends.
